        <td>All creeps, construction sites and dropped resources in the room are removed immediately, even inside ramparts. Damage to structures:
            <ul>
                <li>10,000,000 hits at the landing position;</li>
                <li>5,000,000 hits to all structures in 5x5 area.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that you can stack multiple nukes from different rooms at the same target position to increase damage.</p>
            <p>Nuke landing does not generate tombstones and ruins, and destroys all existing tombstones and ruins in the room</p>
            <p>If the room is in safe mode, then the safe mode is cancelled immediately, and the safe mode cooldown is reset to 0.</p>
            <p>The room controller is hit by triggering <code>upgradeBlocked</code> period, which means it is unavailable to activate safe mode again within the next 200 ticks.</p>
